Fetching the restaurant's menu
=============================

We need to provide you a secret key to allow you to poll our system. This key must be sent in the "Authorization" header of the request. This key is unique for every restaurant location. (Example: 8yCPCvb3dDo1k). We will provide you this key manually via email once you have created that restaurant in our system. Simply tell us the email address that you used to create the account with in our system.

Making the request
------------------

1. The endpoint for fetching the menu is: https://pos.globalfoodsoft.com/pos/menu
2. Method is GET
3. API version must be set to: 1
4. You can select the format (xml or json) by setting the "Accept" header to either "application/xml" or "application/json". Default is JSON.


### Example using JSON

   -X GET \
